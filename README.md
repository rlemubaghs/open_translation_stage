# open_mr_translation_stage
The open_mr_translation_stage repository includes all the 3D models to build your own MRI compatible, water cooled translational stage for combined (functional) MRI and calcium imaging. The open_mr_translation_stage is an open-source project published in Ubaghs et al., "Simultaneous single-cell calcium imaging of neuronal population activity and brain-wide BOLD fMRI." bioRxiv(2023): 2023-11 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.14.566368v1). 

Using this repository, everyone can build their own MRI compatible, water cooled translation stage to accurately position the open_mrscope inside an MRI machine. Please also see related repositories for more tools to perform MRI compatible combined recordings (MR compatible microscope: https://github.com/rlemubaghs/open_mrscope; MR compatible mouse cradle for combined recordings: https://github.com/rlemubaghs/open_mr_cradle_mouse)!

# Credits
This repository was created by Rik Ubaghs and maintained by the Grewe group at the Institute for Neuroinformatics at University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. It has benefitted from the inputs of all authors of the paper Ubaghs et al., "Simultaneous single-cell calcium imaging of neuronal population activity and brain-wide BOLD fMRI." bioRxiv(2023): 2023-11 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.14.566368v1). 

The open_mr_translation_stage is an open-source project, and we encourage people to use, test, modify and further develop these tools. If you have any questions or suggestions, or find any bugs in the codes, please contact us or submit an issue. If you use the project, please cite us!
